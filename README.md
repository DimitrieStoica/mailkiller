# mailkiller

Mail killer is a pop3 facade sitting between your email client and your pop3 server.
It stops all the unknown email that look like spam and enable a user to black list, white list, filter, delete, mark as spam... all messages.

I had enough to have my email box flooded with crap that I put that in place, also as a kind of a programming challenge
